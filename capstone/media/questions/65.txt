A borrower takes out a 15-year loan for 400,000, with level end-of-month payments, at an annual
nominal interest rate of 9% convertible monthly.
Immediately after the 36th payment, the borrower decides to refinance the loan at an annual
nominal interest rate of j, convertible monthly. The remaining term of the loan is kept at twelve
years, and level payments continue to be made at the end of the month. However, each payment
is now 409.88 lower than each payment from the original loan.
