Company X received the approval to start no more than two projects in the current calendar year.
Three different projects were recommended, each of which requires an investment of 800 to be
made at the beginning of the year.
The cash flows for each of the three projects are as follows:


  End of year       Project A          Project B          Project C
       1               500                500               500
       2               500                300               250
       3               –175              –175               –175
       4               100                150               200
       5                0                 200               200
