At an annual effective interest rate of i, i > 0%, the present value of a perpetuity paying 10 at the
end of each 3-year period, with the first payment at the end of year 3, is 32.
At the same annual effective rate of i, the present value of a perpetuity paying 1 at the end of
each 4-month period, with first payment at the end of 4 months, is X.


Calculate X.
