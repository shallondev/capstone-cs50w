A woman worked for 30 years before retiring. At the end of the first year of employment she
deposited 5000 into an account for her retirement. At the end of each subsequent year of
employment, she deposited 3% more than the prior year. The woman made a total of 30
deposits.
She will withdraw 50,000 at the beginning of the first year of retirement and will make annual
withdrawals at the beginning of each subsequent year for a total of 30 withdrawals. Each of
these subsequent withdrawals will be 3% more than the prior year. The final withdrawal
depletes the account.
The account earns a constant annual effective interest rate.


Calculate the account balance after the final deposit and before the first withdrawal.
