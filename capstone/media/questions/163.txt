Determine which of the following statements regarding asset-liability management techniques is
true.


       (A)     Redington immunization requires that the convexity of the liabilities is greater
               than the convexity of the assets.
       (B)     An advantage of the Redington immunization technique over the cash-flow
               matching technique is that the portfolio manager has more investment choices
               available.
       (C)     Both Redington immunization and full immunization are based on the assumption
               that the yield curve has higher yields for longer term investments.
       (D)     A fully immunized portfolio ensures that the present value of assets will exceed
               the present value of liabilities with non-parallel shifts in the yield curve.
       (E)     A cash-flow matched portfolio requires less rebalancing than a Redington
               immunized portfolio, but more rebalancing than a fully immunized portfolio.
