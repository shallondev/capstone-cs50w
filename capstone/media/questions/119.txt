A bank accepts a 20,000 deposit from a customer on which it guarantees to pay an annual
effective interest rate of 10% for two years. The customer needs to withdraw half of the
accumulated value at the end of the first year. The customer will withdraw the remaining value
at the end of the second year.
The bank has the following investment options available, which may be purchased in any
quantity:
       Bond H:        A one-year zero-coupon bond yielding 10% annually
       Bond I:        A two-year zero-coupon bond yielding 11% annually
       Bond J:        A two-year bond that sells at par with 12% annual coupons
Any portion of the 20,000 deposit that is not needed to be invested in bonds is retained by the
bank as profit.


Determine which of the following investment strategies produces the highest profit for the bank
and is guaranteed to meet the customerâ€™s withdrawal needs.
