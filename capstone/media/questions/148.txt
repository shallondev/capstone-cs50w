A 1000-par value 30-year bond has an annual coupon rate of 7% paid semiannually. After an
initial 10-year period of call protection, the bond is callable immediately following the payment
of any of the 20th through the 59th coupons.
       i)      If the bond is called before payment of the 40th coupon, the redemption value is
               1250.
       ii)     If the bond is called immediately after the payment of any of the 40th through the
               59th coupons, the redemption value is 1125.
       iii)    If the bond is not called, it will be redeemed at par.
To ensure that the bond will provide at least an annual nominal yield rate of 5% convertible
semiannually, it must be assumed that the bond will be called or redeemed immediately after the
payment of the nth coupon.
