       (B)     It becomes more expensive for banks to run a shortfall in their reserve accounts;
               thus, banks will be motivated to write fewer loans, and the interest rates charged

       (C)     It becomes more expensive for banks to run a shortfall in their reserve accounts;
               thus, banks will be motivated to write more loans, and the interest rates charged

       (D)     It becomes less expensive for banks to run a shortfall in their reserve accounts;
               thus, banks will be motivated to write more loans, and the interest rates charged
               on these loans will increase.
       (E)     It becomes less expensive for banks to run a shortfall in their reserve accounts;
