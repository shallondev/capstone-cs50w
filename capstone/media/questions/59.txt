An insurance company must pay liabilities of 99 at the end of one year, 102 at the end of two
years and 100 at the end of three years. The only investments available to the company are the
following three bonds. Bond A and Bond C are annual coupon bonds. Bond B is a zero-coupon
bond.
Bond Maturity (in years)      Yield-to-Maturity (Annualized)        Coupon Rate
A                  1                          6%                           7%
B                  2                          7%                           0%
C                  3                          9%                           5%


All three bonds have a par value of 100 and will be redeemed at par.
