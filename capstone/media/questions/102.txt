Jeff has 8000 and would like to purchase a 10,000 bond. In doing so, Jeff takes out a 10 year
loan of 2000 from a bank and will make interest-only payments at the end of each month at a
nominal rate of 8.0% convertible monthly. He immediately pays 10,000 for a 10-year bond with
a par value of 10,000 and 9.0% coupons paid monthly.


Calculate the annual effective yield rate that Jeff will realize on his 8000 over the 10-year period.
