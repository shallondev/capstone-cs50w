A student borrows money to pay for university tuition. He borrows 1000 at the end of each
month for four years. No payments are made to repay the loan until the end of five years.
The loan accumulates interest at a 6% nominal interest rate convertible monthly for the first two
years and at an 8% nominal interest rate convertible monthly for the following two years.


Calculate the loan balance at the end of four years immediately following the receipt of the final
1000.

You enter into a 5-year interest rate swap (with a notional amount of 100,000) to pay a fixed rate
and to receive a floating rate based on future 1-year LIBOR rates. If the swap has annual
payments, what is the fixed rate you should pay?


       (A)     5.20%
       (B)     5.70%

156 (former Question 63 from the set of financial economics questions).
Company ABC has an existing debt of 2,000,000 on which it makes annual payments at an
annual effective rate of LIBOR plus 0.5%.
ABC decides to enter into a swap with a notional amount of 2,000,000, on which it makes annual
payments at a fixed annual effective rate of 3% in exchange for receiving annual payments at the
annual effective LIBOR rate.
The annual effective LIBOR rates over the first and second years of the swap contract are 2.5%
and 4.0%, respectively.
ABC does not make or receive any other payments.


Calculate the net interest payment that ABC makes in the second year.
