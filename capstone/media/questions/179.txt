Katarina has borrowed 300,000 from Trout Bank. Katarina will repay 100,000 of principal at the
end of each of the first three years.
Katarina will pay Trout Bank a variable interest rate equal to the one year spot interest rate at the
beginning of each year.

Under the interest rate swap, Katarina will pay a fixed rate to Lily, and Lily will pay a variable
rate to Katarina. The variable rate will be the same rate that Katarina is paying to Trout Bank.
