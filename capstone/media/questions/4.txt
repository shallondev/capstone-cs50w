John borrows 10,000 for 10 years at an annual effective interest rate of 10%. He can repay this
loan using the amortization method with payments of 1,627.45 at the end of each year. Instead,
John repays the 10,000 using a sinking fund that pays an annual effective interest rate of 14%.
The deposits to the sinking fund are equal to 1,627.45 minus the interest on the loan and are
made at the end of each year for 10 years.


Calculate the balance in the sinking fund immediately after repayment of the loan.
