Bill buys a 10-year 1000 par value bond with semi-annual coupons paid at an annual rate of 6%.
The price assumes an annual nominal yield of 6%, compounded semi-annually.
As Bill receives each coupon payment, he immediately puts the money into an account earning
interest at an annual effective rate of i.
At the end of 10 years, immediately after Bill receives the final coupon payment and the
redemption value of the bond, Bill has earned an annual effective yield of 7% on his investment
in the bond.
