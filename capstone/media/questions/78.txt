A borrower takes out a 15-year loan for 65,000, with level end-of-month payments. The annual
nominal interest rate of the loan is 8%, convertible monthly.
Immediately after the 12th payment is made, the remaining loan balance is reamortized. The
maturity date of the loan remains unchanged, but the annual nominal interest rate of the loan is
changed to 6%, convertible monthly.
