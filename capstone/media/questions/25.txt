Seth, Janice, and Lori each borrow 5000 for five years at an annual nominal interest rate of 12%,
compounded semi-annually.
Seth has interest accumulated over the five years and pays all the interest and principal in a lump
sum at the end of five years.
Janice pays interest at the end of every six-month period as it accrues and the principal at the end
of five years.
Lori repays her loan with 10 level payments at the end of every six-month period.
