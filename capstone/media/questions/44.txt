Joe must pay liabilities of 1,000 due one year from now and another 2,000 due three years from
now. There are two available investments:
Bond I: A one-year zero-coupon bond that matures for 1000. The yield rate is 6% per year
Bond II: A two-year zero-coupon bond with face amount of 1,000. The yield rate is 7% per year.
At the present time the one-year forward rate for an investment made two years from now is
6.5%


Joe plans to buy amounts of each bond. He plans to reinvest the proceeds from Bond II in a one-
year zero-coupon bond. Assuming the reinvestment earns the forward rate, calculate the total
purchase price of Bond I and Bond II where the amounts are selected to exactly match the
liabilities.
