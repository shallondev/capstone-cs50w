Mike buys a perpetuity-immediate with varying annual payments. During the first 5 years, the
payment is constant and equal to 10. Beginning in year 6, the payments start to increase. For
year 6 and all future years, the payment in that year is K% larger than the payment in the year
immediately preceding that year, where K < 9.2.
At an annual effective interest rate of 9.2%, the perpetuity has a present value of 167.50.
