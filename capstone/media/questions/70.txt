A student takes out a five-year loan of 1000. Interest on the loan is at an annual effective interest
rate of i.
At the end of each year, the student pays the interest due on the loan and makes a deposit of
twice the amount of that interest payment into a sinking fund. The sinking fund credits interest
at an annual effective rate of 0.8i. The sinking fund will accumulate the amount needed to pay
off the loan at the end of five years.
