Ron is repaying a loan with payments of 1 at the end of each year for n years. The annual
effective interest rate on the loan is i. The amount of interest paid in year t plus the amount of
principal repaid in year t + 1 equals X.
Determine which of the following is equal to X.
                  v n −t
       (A)     1+
                    i
                  v n −t
       (B)     1+
                   d
       (C)     1 + v n −t i
       (D)     1 + v n −t d
       (E)     1 + v n −t
