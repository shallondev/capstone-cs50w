Lucas opens a bank account with 1000 and lets it accumulate at an annual nominal interest rate
of 6% convertible semiannually. Danielle also opens a bank account with 1000 at the same time
as Lucas, but it grows at an annual nominal interest rate of 3% convertible monthly.
For each account, interest is credited only at the end of each interest conversion period.


Calculate the number of months required for the amount in Lucas’s account to be at least double
the amount in Danielle’s account.
