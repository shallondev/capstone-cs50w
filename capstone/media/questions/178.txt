Porter makes three-year loans that include inflation protection. The annual interest rate
compounded continuously that must be paid is 3.2% plus the rate of inflation.
The U.S. government borrows 100,000 for three years from Porter. The actual annual inflation
rate during the first year was 2.4% compounded continuously. The actual annual inflation rates
for the second and third years respectively was 2.8% and 4.2% compounded continuously.
The U.S. government is considered a risk free borrower, which means there is no chance of
default.
