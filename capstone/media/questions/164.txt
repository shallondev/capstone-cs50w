A company has liabilities that require it to make payments of 1000 at the end of each of the next
five years. The only investments available to the company are as follows:


Investment     Price Subsequent Cash Flows
J              1500    500 at the end of each year for 5 years
K              500     1000 at the end of year 5
L              1000    500 at the end of each year for 4 years
M              4000    1000 at the end of each year for 5 years


The company is able to purchase as many of each investment as it wants, but only in whole units.
The companyâ€™s investment objective is to be fully immunized over the next five years.


Calculate the lowest possible cost to achieve this objective.
