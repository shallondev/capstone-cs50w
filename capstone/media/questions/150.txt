A life insurance company invests two million in a 10-year zero-coupon bond and four million in
a 30-year zero-coupon bond. The annual effective yield rate for both bonds is 8%.
When the 10-year bond matures, the company reinvests the proceeds in another 10-year zero-
coupon bond. At that time the bond yield rate is 12% annual effective.
After 20 years from the initial investment, the 30-year bond is sold to yield an annual effective
rate of 10% to the buyer. The maturity of the second 10-year bond and the sale of the 30-year
bond result in a gain of X on the companyâ€™s initial investment of six million.


Calculate X.


       (A)     23 million

       (C)     32 million
       (D)     34 million
       (E)     42 million
