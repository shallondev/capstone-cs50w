A company plans to invest X at the beginning of each month in a zero-coupon bond in order to
accumulate 100,000 at the end of six months. The price of each bond as a percentage of
redemption value is given in the following chart:
                 Maturity (months)      1       2       3      4       5      6
                         Price         99%    98%     97%    96%     95%     94%


Calculate X given that the bond prices will not change during the six-month period.
