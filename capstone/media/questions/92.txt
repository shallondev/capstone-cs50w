A perpetuity provides for continuous payments. The annual rate of payment at time t is
1,              for 0 ≤ t < 10,
 
 (1.03)
          t −10
                  for t ≥ 10.

Using an annual effective interest rate of 6%, the present value at time t = 0 of this perpetuity is
x.


Calculate x.
