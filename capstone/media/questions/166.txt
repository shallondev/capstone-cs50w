A company must pay liabilities of 1000 at the end of year 1 and X at the end of year 2.
The only investments available are:
        i)       One-year zero-coupon bonds with an annual effective yield of 5%
        ii)      Two-year bonds with a par value of 1000 and 10% annual coupons, with
                 an annual effective yield of 6%
The company constructed a portfolio that creates an exact cash flow matching strategy for these
liabilities. The total purchase price of this portfolio is 1783.76.
