An investor purchases two bonds. The bonds have the same annual effective yield rate i, with
i > 0.
With respect to the annual effective yield rate, their modified durations are a years and b years,
with 0 < a < b.
One of these two bonds has a Macaulay duration of c years, with a < c < b.


Determine which of the following is an expression, in years, for the Macaulay duration of the
other bond.


       (A)     bc/a
       (B)     ac/b
       (C)     ab/c
       (D)     b+c–a
       (E)     a+c–b
