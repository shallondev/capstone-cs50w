On January 1, an investment account is worth 50,000. On May 1, the value has increased to
52,000 and 8,000 of new principal is deposited. At time t, in years, (4/12 < t < 1) the value of the
fund has increased to 62,000 and 10,000 is withdrawn. On January 1 of the next year, the
investment account is worth 55,000. The dollar-weighted rate of return (using the simple interest
approximation) is equal to the time-weighted rate of return for the year.
