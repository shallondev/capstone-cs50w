You are given:


i)        F = the amount in a fund at the beginning of the year
ii)       There are n cash flows during the year, where each cash flow, Ck , k = 1, 2, , n is made
          at time tk , 0 < t ≤ 1 .
iii)      I = the amount of interest earned during the year.


Consider the formula
                  I
i=          n
                            .
       F + ∑ Ck (1 − tk )
           k =1




Determine which of the following conditions produces i closest to the annual effective yield rate.


          (A)         When each cash flow is small relative to F
          (B)         When each cash flow is large relative to F
          (C)         When each cash flow is large relative to I
          (D)         When the cash flows all have the same sign
          (E)         When the timing of cash flows is uniform throughout the year
