As of 12/31/2013, an insurance company has a known obligation to pay 1,000,000 on
12/31/2017. To fund this liability, the company immediately purchases 4-year 5% annual
coupon bonds totaling 822,703 of par value. The company anticipates reinvestment interest rates
to remain constant at 5% through 12/31/2017. The maturity value of the bond equals the par
value.
Consider two reinvestment interest rate movement scenarios effective 1/1/2014. Scenario A has
interest rates drop by 0.5%. Scenario B has interest rates increase by 0.5%.


Determine which of the following best describes the insurance company’s profit or (loss) as of
12/31/2017 after the liability is paid.


       (A)     Scenario A – 6,610, Scenario B – 11,150
       (B)     Scenario A – (14,760), Scenario B – 14,420
       (C)     Scenario A – (18,910), Scenario B – 19,190
       (D)     Scenario A – (1,310), Scenario B – 1,320
       (E)     Scenario A – 0, Scenario B – 0
